# My Version

Many of Taylor Swift’s songs can fit a wide range of moods, which can make curating the perfect playlist at any given moment tedious. 

My Version is an app that gives users the ability to assign one or more “moods” to each of her songs, so the user can easily generate a unique playlist based on their current mood. 


## Features

- Browse Taylor Swift's entire music catalog.
- Add and delete unlimited "moods".
- Generate playlists based on one or more "moods".

## Lessons Learned

This was a 3 week long project built at the end of Nashville Software School's client side term. The goal of this project was to build an application following the principles of the CRUD cycle using technologies learned up until this point.

I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull a list of Taylor Swift songs using multiple "moods" that he or she had attached to each song. One of the main challenges I ran into was filtering the songs that contained more than one "mood". This led me to spending time diving into various array methods that would allow me to loop through all the songs and "moods" to pull out specific songs that matched the users criteria. 

The technologies implemented in this project are React, VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use CSS over other frameworks so that I could focus my attention on becoming more familiar with React.
